## Project Structure

This is a monorepo with the following structure:

- **`apps/web/`** - Fullstack application
- **`apps/mini/`** - Weixin Mini Program

- **`packages/api/`** - Shared API logic and types
- **`packages/auth/`** - Authentication logic and utilities
- **`packages/db/`** - Database schema and utilities


## Available Scripts

- `bun run dev` - Start all apps in development mode

## Database Commands

All database operations should be run from the web workspace:

- `bun run db:push` - Push schema changes to database
- `bun run db:studio` - Open database studio
- `bun run db:generate` - Generate Drizzle files
- `bun run db:migrate` - Run database migrations

Database schema files are located in `apps/web/src/db/schema/`

## API Structure

- oRPC endpoints are in `packages/api/src/api/`
- Client-side API utils are in `apps/web/src/utils/api.ts`

## Authentication

Authentication is enabled in this project:
- Server auth logic is in `packages/auth/src/lib/auth.ts`
- Web app auth client is in `apps/web/src/lib/auth-client.ts`

## Key Points

- This is a monorepo using bun workspaces
- Each app has its own `package.json` and dependencies
- Run commands from the root to execute across all workspaces
- Run workspace-specific commands with `bun run command-name`

## Conventions & Patterns

- Use `@/` alias for imports from `src/` directory
- Prefer functional programming, interfaces over types
- Minimize `useEffect`, `setState`

## Important Notes

- Before generated code uses the MCP "context7" to enforce best practices and idiomatic usage
- After the code is generated or modify, run `bun run fix:biome` and fix error
- Dialogue in Chinese
