## 🔴 Current Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. Route Registration & Layout Issues

**Problem**: New public pages (landing, pricing, about) are standalone with their own header/footer
**Conflict**: Existing `(public)/route.tsx` has shared layout with `<Outlet />` for child routes

**Impact**:

- Landing page at `/` may conflict with existing homepage
- TypeScript errors about missing routes (`/landing`, `/pricing`, `/about`)
- Inconsistent navigation (some pages use shared layout, some don't)

**Files Affected**:

- `apps/web/src/routes/(public)/landing/index.tsx` - Standalone page
- `apps/web/src/routes/(public)/pricing/index.tsx` - Standalone page
- `apps/web/src/routes/(public)/about/index.tsx` - Standalone page
- `apps/web/src/routes/(public)/route.tsx` - Shared layout

### 2. TypeScript Type Warnings (Pre-existing)

**Pre-existing issues across the project**:

- `session.user.activeOrganizationId` - Property exists at runtime but not in TypeScript types
- `queryOptions()` - Type mismatch between expected `{ input: {...} }` and actual usage
- These affect: admin dashboard, org dashboard, org switcher, auth guards

**Impact**: No blocking - code works at runtime, but IDE shows warnings

### 3. Login Page Integration Missing

**Problem**: Invitation accept page expects login page to handle `invitationId` and `redirect` query params
**Status**: Login page not updated to accept invitation flow
**Missing**: Logic to handle post-login redirect after invitation acceptance

### 4. Route Tree Not Regenerated

**Problem**: New routes (`/landing`, `/pricing`, `/about`) not showing in TypeScript route tree
**Required**: Route tree regeneration via TanStack Router
**Command needed**: `bun run dev` to trigger route tree regeneration

---

## 🎯 Evolution Phases

### Phase 7: Route Registration & Layout Consistency (IN PROGRESS)

**Priority**: 🚨 HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 30-60 minutes

**Analysis Complete**: Agent analysis received for navigation components

**Current State**:

- Header Component (`header.tsx`): Links array has only `[{ to: "/", label: "Home" }]`
- Footer Component (`footer.tsx`): Has Terms/Privacy/Contact links, missing public pages
- Individual pages (landing/pricing/about): Have their own inline navigation, don't use shared layout

**Critical Discovery**:

- Navigation inconsistency: Individual pages don't use shared Header/Footer from `(public)/route.tsx`
- Missing routes: TypeScript errors about `/pricing` and `/about` routes

**Implementation Plan**:

1. **Update Header Component** - Add Pricing/About links to links array
2. **Update Footer Component** - Replace placeholder links with Home/Pricing/About + Terms
3. **Regenerate Route Tree** - Run `bun run dev` to register new routes
4. **Verify TypeScript** - Run `bun run check-types` after regeneration

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] All public pages accessible without errors
- [ ] Consistent header/footer across all public pages
- [ ] No TypeScript errors about missing routes
- [ ] Navigation works correctly between all public pages

---

### Phase 8: Login Page Integration (MEDIUM)

**Priority**: ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

**Tasks**:

1. **Update login page to handle invitation flow**
   - File: `apps/web/src/routes/(auth)/login.tsx`
   - Extract `invitationId` and `redirect` from `useSearch()`
   - On successful login:
     - If `invitationId` exists: Call `acceptInvitation.mutate({ invitationId })`
     - Navigate to `redirect` param (or `/org/dashboard` if not specified)
     - Handle errors for invalid/expired invitations

2. **Update sign-in form post-login redirect**
   - File: `apps/web/src/components/sign-in-form.tsx`
   - Current logic: Redirect based on role (admin → /admin, user → /org)
   - New logic: Check for `redirect` query param, use it if exists
   - Maintain role-based redirect as fallback

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Login page accepts invitationId and redirect params
- [ ] Post-login handles invitation acceptance automatically
- [ ] Error handling for invalid/expired invitations
- [ ] Toast notifications for success/failure
- [ ] Redirect to correct page after login

### Phase 9: Manual QA & Testing (HIGH)

**Priority**: 🚨 HIGH
**Estimated Time**: 60-90 minutes

**Tasks**:

#### 9.1: Functional Testing

**Security & Auth**:

- [ ] Login as admin → redirects to `/admin/dashboard`
- [ ] Login as regular user → redirects to `/org/dashboard`

- [ ] Sidebar displays correct user name, email, avatar

**Core Experience**:

- [ ] Org switcher displays all user organizations

### Phase 10: Code Quality & Type Safety (MEDIUM)

**Priority**: ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

**Tasks**:

1. **Fix or document TypeScript type warnings**
   - File: `apps/web/src/lib/auth-guards.ts`

   - Verify no imports marked as unused

3. **Fix oRPC queryOptions pattern**
   - Ensure all queries use `{ input: {...} }` pattern
   - Document why current pattern works despite type mismatch
   - Consider updating oRPC types if possible

4. **Run final code quality checks**

### Phase 11: Performance Optimization (LOW)

**Priority**: 💡 LOW (Nice to have)
**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

**Tasks**:

1. **Optimize query caching**
   - Add `staleTime` to frequently accessed queries
   - Add `gcTime` to reduce memory usage
   - Prefetch data on route entry (TanStack Router `beforeLoad`)

2. **Reduce re-renders**
   - Use `React.memo()` for expensive components
   - Add `key` props to list items properly
   - Avoid inline function definitions in render

3. **Code splitting**
   - Lazy load heavy routes (dashboards with complex queries)
   - Use TanStack Router's lazy loading
   - Reduce initial bundle size

4. **Image optimization**
   - Add lazy loading for avatar images
   - Add error handling for broken images
